(** * Inductively Defined Propositions *)

(** In the [Logic] chapter, we looked at several ways of writing
    propositions, including conjunction, disjunction, and existential
    quantification.

    In this chapter, we bring yet another new tool into the mix:
    _inductively defined propositions_.

    To begin, some examples... *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The Collatz Conjecture *)

(** The _Collatz Conjecture_ is a famous open problem in number
    theory.

    Its statement is surprisingly simple.  First, we define a function
    [f] on numbers, as follows: *)

Fixpoint div2 (n : nat) :=
  match n with
    0 => 0
  | 1 => 0
  | S (S n) => S (div2 n)
  end.

Definition f (n : nat) :=
  if even n then div2 n
  else (3 * n) + 1.

(** Next, we look at what happens when we repeatedly apply [f] to some
    given starting number.  For example, [f 12] is [6], and [f 6] is
    [3], so by repeatedly applying [f] we get the sequence [12, 6, 3,
    10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1].

    Similarly, if we start with [19], we get the longer sequence [19,
    58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8,
    4, 2, 1].

    Both of these sequences eventually reach [1].  The question posed
    by Collatz was: Does the sequence starting from _any_ natural
    number eventually reach [1]? *)

(** To formalize this question in Coq, we might try to define a
    recursive _function_ that computes the total number of steps that
    it takes for such a sequence to reach [1]. *)

Fail Fixpoint reaches_1_in (n : nat) :=
  if n =? 1 then 0
  else 1 + reaches_1_in (f n).

(** This definition is rejected by Coq's termination checker, since
    the argument to the recursive call, [f n], is not "obviously
    smaller" than [n].

    Indeed, this isn't just a silly limitation of the termination
    checker.  Functions in Coq are required to be total, and checking
    that this particular function is total would be equivalent to
    settling the Collatz conjecture! *)

(** Fortunately, there is another way to do it: We can express the
    concept "reaches [1] eventually" as an _inductively defined
    property_ of numbers: *)

Inductive reaches_1 : nat -> Prop :=
  | term_done : reaches_1 1
  | term_more (n : nat) : reaches_1 (f n) -> reaches_1 n.

(** The details of such definitions are written will be explained
    below; for the moment, the way to read this one is: "The number
    [1] reaches [1], and any number [n] reaches [1] if [f n] does." *)

(** The Collatz conjecture then states that the sequence beginning
    from _any_ number reaches [1]: *)

Conjecture collatz : forall n, reaches_1 n.

(** If you succeed in proving this conjecture, you've got a bright
    future as a number theorist.  But don't spend too long on it --
    it's been open since 1937! *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Transitive Closure *)

(** A binary _relation_ on a set [X] is a family of propositions
    parameterized by two elements of [X] -- i.e., a proposition about
    pairs of elements of [X].  *)

(** For example, a familiar binary relation on [nat] is [le], the
    less-than-or-equal-to relation. *)

Module LePlayground.

(** The following definition says that there are two ways to
    show that one number is less than or equal to another: either
    observe that they are the same number, or, if the second has the
    form [S m], give evidence that the first is less than or equal to
    [m]. *)

Inductive le : nat -> nat -> Prop :=
  | le_n (n : nat)   : le n n
  | le_S (n m : nat) : le n m -> le n (S m).

End LePlayground.

(** The _transitive closure_ of a relation [R] is the smallest
    relation that contains [R] and that is transitive.  *)

Inductive clos_trans {X: Type} (R: X->X->Prop) : X->X->Prop :=
  | t_step (x y : X) :
      R x y ->
      clos_trans R x y
  | t_trans (x y z : X) :
      clos_trans R x y ->
      clos_trans R y z ->
      clos_trans R x z.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard, optional (close_refl_trans)

    How would you modify this definition so that it defines _reflexive
    and_ transitive closure?  How about reflexive, symmetric, and
    transitive closure? *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Permutations *)

(** The familiar mathematical concept of _permutation_ also has an
    elegant formulation as an inductive relation.  For simplicity,
    let's focus on permutations of lists with exactly three
    elements. *)

Inductive Perm3 {X : Type} : list X -> list X -> Prop :=
  | perm3_swap12 (a b c : X) :
      Perm3 [a;b;c] [b;a;c]
  | perm3_swap23 (a b c : X) :
      Perm3 [a;b;c] [a;c;b]
  | perm3_trans (l1 l2 l3 : list X) :
      Perm3 l1 l2 -> Perm3 l2 l3 -> Perm3 l1 l3.

(** This definition says:
      - If [l2] can be obtained from [l1] by swapping the first and
        second elements, then [l2] is a permutation of [l1].
      - If [l2] can be obtained from [l1] by swapping the second and
        third elements, then [l2] is a permutation of [l1].
      - If [l2] is a permutation of [l1] and [l3] is a permutation of
        [l2], then [l3] is a permutation of [l1]. *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard, optional (perm)

    According to this definition, is [[1;2;3]] a permutation of
    [[3;2;1]]?  Is [[1;2;3]] it a permutation of itself? *)

(* FILL IN HERE

    [] *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Evenness (yet again) *)

(** We've already seen two ways of stating a proposition that a number
    [n] is even: We can say

      (1) [even n = true], or

      (2) [exists k, n = double k].

    A third possibility, which we'll use as a running example for the
    rest of this chapter, is to say that [n] is even if we can
    _establish_ its evenness from the following rules:

       - The number [0] is even.
       - If [n] is even, then [S (S n)] is even. *)

(** (Defining evenness in this way may seem a bit confusing,
    since we have already seen another perfectly good way of doing
    it -- "[n] is even if it is equal to the result of doubling some
    number". But it makes a convenient running example because it is
    simple and compact.) *)

(** To illustrate how this new definition of evenness works,
    let's imagine using it to show that [4] is even. First, we give
    the rules names for easy reference:
       - Rule [ev_0]: The number [0] is even.
       - Rule [ev_SS]: If [n] is even, then [S (S n)] is even.

    Now, by rule [ev_SS], it suffices to show that [2] is even. This,
    in turn, is again guaranteed by rule [ev_SS], as long as we can
    show that [0] is even. But this last fact follows directly from
    the [ev_0] rule. *)

(** We can translate the informal definition of evenness from above
    into a formal [Inductive] declaration, where each "way that a
    number can be even" corresponds to a separate constructor: *)

Inductive ev : nat -> Prop :=
  | ev_0                       : ev 0
  | ev_SS (n : nat) (H : ev n) : ev (S (S n)).

(** This definition is interestingly different from previous uses of
    [Inductive].  For one thing, we are defining not a [Type] (like
    [nat]) or a function yielding a [Type] (like [list]), but rather a
    function from [nat] to [Prop] -- that is, a property of numbers.
    But what is really new is that, because the [nat] argument of [ev]
    appears to the _right_ of the colon on the first line, it is
    allowed to take _different_ values in the types of different
    constructors: [0] in the type of [ev_0] and [S (S n)] in the type
    of [ev_SS].  Accordingly, the type of each constructor must be
    specified explicitly (after a colon), and each constructor's type
    must have the form [ev n] for some natural number [n].

    In contrast, recall the definition of [list]:

    Inductive list (X:Type) : Type :=
      | nil
      | cons (x : X) (l : list X).

    or equivalently:

    Inductive list (X:Type) : Type :=
      | nil                       : list X
      | cons (x : X) (l : list X) : list X.

   This definition introduces the [X] parameter _globally_, to the
   _left_ of the colon, forcing the result of [nil] and [cons] to be
   the same type (i.e., [list X]).  But if we had tried to bring [nat]
   to the left of the colon in defining [ev], we would have seen an
   error: *)

Fail Inductive wrong_ev (n : nat) : Prop :=
  | wrong_ev_0 : wrong_ev 0
  | wrong_ev_SS (H: wrong_ev n) : wrong_ev (S (S n)).
(* ===> Error: Last occurrence of "[wrong_ev]" must have "[n]" as 1st
        argument in "[wrong_ev 0]". *)

(** In an [Inductive] definition, an argument to the type constructor
    on the left of the colon is called a "parameter", whereas an
    argument on the right is called an "index" or "annotation."

    For example, in [Inductive list (X : Type) := ...], the [X] is a
    parameter, while in [Inductive ev : nat -> Prop := ...], the
    unnamed [nat] argument is an index. *)

(** We can think of this as defining a Coq property [ev : nat ->
    Prop], together with "evidence constructors" [ev_0 : ev 0] and
    [ev_SS : forall n, ev n -> ev (S (S n))]. *)

(** These evidence constructors can be thought of as "primitive
    evidence of evenness", and they can be used just like proven
    theorems.  In particular, we can use Coq's [apply] tactic with the
    constructor names to obtain evidence for [ev] of particular
    numbers... *)

Theorem ev_4 : ev 4.
Proof. apply ev_SS. apply ev_SS. apply ev_0. Qed.

(** ... or we can use function application syntax to combine several
    constructors: *)

Theorem ev_4' : ev 4.
Proof. apply (ev_SS 2 (ev_SS 0 ev_0)). Qed.

(** In this way, we can also prove theorems that have hypotheses
    involving [ev]. *)

  - simpl. apply ev_SS. apply IHn. Qed.
(** [] *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Using Evidence in Proofs *)

(** Besides _constructing_ evidence that numbers are even, we can also
    _destruct_ such evidence, reasoning about how it could have been
    built.

    Introducing [ev] with an [Inductive] declaration tells Coq not
    only that the constructors [ev_0] and [ev_SS] are valid ways to
    build evidence that some number is [ev], but also that these two
    constructors are the _only_ ways to build evidence that numbers
    are [ev]. *)

(** In other words, if someone gives us evidence [E] for the assertion
    [ev n], then we know that [E] must be one of two things:

      - [E] is [ev_0] (and [n] is [O]), or
      - [E] is [ev_SS n' E'] (and [n] is [S (S n')], where [E'] is
        evidence for [ev n']). *)

(** This suggests that it should be possible to analyze a
    hypothesis of the form [ev n] much as we do inductively defined
    data structures; in particular, it should be possible to argue by
    _case analysis_ or by _induction_ on such evidence.  Let's look at a
    few examples to see what this means in practice. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inversion on Evidence *)

(** Suppose we are proving some fact involving a number [n], and
    we are given [ev n] as a hypothesis.  We already know how to
    perform case analysis on [n] using [destruct] or [induction],
    generating separate subgoals for the case where [n = O] and the
    case where [n = S n'] for some [n'].  But for some proofs we may
    instead want to analyze the evidence for [ev n] _directly_.

    As a tool for such proofs, we can formalize the intuitive
    characterization that we gave above for evidence of [ev n], using
    [destruct]. *)

Theorem ev_inversion : forall (n : nat),
    ev n ->
    (n = 0) \/ (exists n', n = S (S n') /\ ev n').
Proof.
  intros n E.  destruct E as [ | n' E'] eqn:EE.
  - (* E = ev_0 : ev 0 *)
    left. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' : ev (S (S n')) *)
    right. exists n'. split. reflexivity. apply E'.
Qed.

(** Facts like this are often called "inversion lemmas" because they
    allow us to "invert" some given information to reason about all
    the different ways it could have been derived.

    Here, there are two ways to prove [ev n], and the inversion lemma
    makes this explicit. *)

    (** Similarly, the following theorem can easily be proved using
        [destruct] on evidence. *)

    Theorem ev_minus2 : forall n,
      ev n -> ev (pred (pred n)).
    Proof.
      intros n E.  destruct E as [| n' E'] eqn:EE.
      - (* E = ev_0 *)
        simpl. apply ev_0.
      - (* E = ev_SS n' E' *)
        simpl. apply E'.
    Qed.

        (** However, the following simple variation shows that [destruct] can
        sometimes throw away critical information: *)

    Theorem evSS_ev_first_try : forall n,
      ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
  intros n E.  destruct E as [| n' E'] eqn:EE.
      - (* E = ev_0. *)
        (* Looks like we must prove that [n] is even... but there are no
           useful assumptions! *)
    Abort.

    
    (** What happened here, exactly?  Calling [destruct] has the effect
        of replacing all occurrences of the property argument by the
        values that correspond to each constructor.  This is enough in the
        case of [ev_minus2] because that argument [n] is mentioned
        directly in the final goal. However, it doesn't help in the case
        of [evSS_ev] since the term that gets replaced -- [S (S n)] -- is
        not mentioned anywhere! *)

        
        (** We can fix this by [remember]ing that term [S (S n)], the
        proof goes through.  (We'll discuss [remember] in more detail
        below.) *)

    
    Theorem evSS_ev_remember : forall n,
      ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
    Proof.

           rewritten as [0 = S (S n)] by [destruct]. That assumption
           gives us a contradiction. *)
        discriminate Hk.
      - (* E = ev_S n' E' *)

    Qed.
    
        (** Alternatively, the proof is straightforward using the inversion
        lemma that we proved above. *)

(** We can use the inversion lemma that we proved above to help
    structure proofs: *)

Theorem evSS_ev_inv : forall n, ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
  intros n H. apply ev_inversion in H.  destruct H as [H0|H1].
  - discriminate H0.
  - destruct H1 as [n' [Hnm Hev]]. injection Hnm as Heq.
    rewrite Heq. apply Hev.
Qed.

(** Note how the inversion lemma produces two subgoals, which
    correspond to the two ways of proving [ev].  The first subgoal is
    a contradiction that is discharged with [discriminate].  The
    second subgoal makes use of [injection] and [rewrite].

    Coq provides a handy tactic called [inversion] that factors out
    this common pattern, saving us the trouble of explicitly stating
    and proving an inversion lemma for every [Inductive] definition we
    make.

    Here, the [inversion] tactic can detect (1) that the first case,
    where [n = 0], does not apply and (2) that the [n'] that appears
    in the [ev_SS] case must be the same as [n].  It includes an
    "[as]" annotation similar to [destruct], allowing us to assign
    names rather than have Coq choose them. *)

Theorem evSS_ev' : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.

  intros n E.  inversion E as [| n' E' Heq].

(** The [inversion] tactic can apply the principle of explosion to

(** The [inversion] tactic does quite a bit of work. For
    example, when applied to an equality assumption, it does the work
    of both [discriminate] and [injection]. In addition, it carries
    out the [intros] and [rewrite]s that are typically necessary in
    the case of [injection]. It can also be applied to analyze
    evidence for arbitrary inductively defined propositions, not just
    equality.  As examples, we'll use it to re-prove some theorems
    from chapter [Tactics].  (Here we are being a bit lazy by
    omitting the [as] clause from [inversion], thereby asking Coq to
    choose names for the variables and hypotheses that it introduces.) *)

Theorem inversion_ex2 : forall (n : nat),
  S n = O -> 2 + 2 = 5.
Proof.
  intros n contra. inversion contra. Qed.

(** Here's how [inversion] works in general.
      - Suppose the name [H] refers to an assumption [P] in the
        current context, where [P] has been defined by an [Inductive]
        declaration.
      - Then, for each of the constructors of [P], [inversion H]
        generates a subgoal in which [H] has been replaced by the
        specific conditions under which this constructor could have
        been used to prove [P].
      - Some of these subgoals will be self-contradictory; [inversion]
        throws these away.
      - The ones that are left represent the cases that must be proved
        to establish the original goal.  For those, [inversion] adds
        to the proof context all equations that must hold of the
        arguments given to [P] -- e.g., [S (S n') = n] in the proof of
        [evSS_ev]). *)

(** The [ev_double] exercise above shows that our new notion of
    evenness is implied by the two earlier ones (since, by
    [even_bool_prop] in chapter [Logic], we already know that
    those are equivalent to each other). To show that all three
    coincide, we just need the following lemma. *)

Lemma ev_Even_firsttry : forall n,
  ev n -> Even n.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *) unfold Even.

(** We could try to proceed by case analysis or induction on [n].  But
    since [ev] is mentioned in a premise, this strategy seems
    unpromising, because (as we've noted before) the induction
    hypothesis will talk about [n-1] (which is _not_ even!).  Thus, it
    seems better to first try [inversion] on the evidence for [ev].
    Indeed, the first case can be solved trivially. And we can
    seemingly make progress on the second case with a helper lemma. *)

  intros n E. inversion E as [EQ' | n' E' EQ'].
  - (* E = ev_0 *) exists 0. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E'

    Unfortunately, the second case is harder.  We need to show [exists
    n0, S (S n') = double n0], but the only available assumption is
    [E'], which states that [ev n'] holds.  Since this isn't directly
    useful, it seems that we are stuck and that performing case
    analysis on [E] was a waste of time.

    If we look more closely at our second goal, however, we can see
    that something interesting happened: By performing case analysis
    on [E], we were able to reduce the original result to a similar
    one that involves a _different_ piece of evidence for [ev]: namely
    [E'].  More formally, we could finish our proof if we could show
    that

        exists k', n' = double k',

    which is the same as the original statement, but with [n'] instead
    of [n].  Indeed, it is not difficult to convince Coq that this
    intermediate result would suffice. *)
    assert (H: (exists k', n' = double k')
               -> (exists n0, S (S n') = double n0)).
        { intros [k' EQ'']. exists (S k'). simpl.
          rewrite <- EQ''. reflexivity. }
    apply H.

    (** Unfortunately, now we are stuck. To see this clearly, let's
        move [E'] back into the goal from the hypotheses. *)

    generalize dependent E'.

    (** Now it is obvious that we are trying to prove another instance
        of the same theorem we set out to prove -- only here we are
        talking about [n'] instead of [n]. *)
Abort.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Induction on Evidence *)

(** If this story feels familiar, it is no coincidence: We've
    encountered similar problems in the [Induction] chapter, when
    trying to use case analysis to prove results that required
    induction.  And once again the solution is... induction! *)

(** The behavior of [induction] on evidence is the same as its
    behavior on data: It causes Coq to generate one subgoal for each
    constructor that could have used to build that evidence, while
    providing an induction hypothesis for each recursive occurrence of
    the property in question.

    To prove that a property of [n] holds for all even numbers (i.e.,
    those for which [ev n] holds), we can use induction on [ev
    n]. This requires us to prove two things, corresponding to the two
    ways in which [ev n] could have been constructed. If it was
    constructed by [ev_0], then [n=0] and the property must hold of
    [0]. If it was constructed by [ev_SS], then the evidence of [ev n]
    is of the form [ev_SS n' E'], where [n = S (S n')] and [E'] is
    evidence for [ev n']. In this case, the inductive hypothesis says
    that the property we are trying to prove holds for [n']. *)

(** Let's try proving that lemma again: *)

Lemma ev_Even : forall n,
  ev n -> Even n.
Proof.
  intros n E.
  induction E as [|n' E' IH].
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    unfold Even. exists 0. reflexivity.

    unfold Even in IH.
    destruct IH as [k Hk].
    rewrite Hk.

(** * Inductive Relations *)

(** A proposition parameterized by a number (such as [ev])
    can be thought of as a _property_ -- i.e., it defines
    a subset of [nat], namely those numbers for which the proposition
    is provable.  In the same way, a two-argument proposition can be
    thought of as a _relation_ -- i.e., it defines a set of pairs for
    which the proposition is provable. *)

(** Just like properties, relations can be defined inductively.  One
    useful example is the "less than or equal to" relation on numbers
    that we briefly saw above. *)

Inductive le : nat -> nat -> Prop :=
  | le_n (n : nat)                : le n n
  | le_S (n m : nat) (H : le n m) : le n (S m).

Notation "n <= m" := (le n m).

(** (We've written the definition a bit differently this time,
    giving explicit names to the arguments to the constructors and
    moving them to the left of the colons.) *)

(** Proofs of facts about [<=] using the constructors [le_n] and
    [le_S] follow the same patterns as proofs about properties, like
    [ev] above. We can [apply] the constructors to prove [<=]
    goals (e.g., to show that [3<=3] or [3<=6]), and we can use
    tactics like [inversion] to extract information from [<=]
    hypotheses in the context (e.g., to prove that [(2 <= 1) ->
    2+2=5].) *)

(** Here are some sanity checks on the definition.  (Notice that,
    although these are the same kind of simple "unit tests" as we gave
    for the testing functions we wrote in the first few lectures, we
    must construct their proofs explicitly -- [simpl] and
    [reflexivity] don't do the job, because the proofs aren't just a
    matter of simplifying computations.) *)

(** * Case Study: Improving Reflection *)

(** We've seen in the [Logic] chapter that we often need to
    relate boolean computations to statements in [Prop].  But
    performing this conversion as we did there can result in
    tedious proof scripts.  Consider the proof of the following
    theorem: *)

Theorem filter_not_empty_In : forall n l,
  filter (fun x => n =? x) l <> [] ->
  In n l.
Proof.
  intros n l. induction l as [|m l' IHl'].
  - (* l = [] *)
    simpl. intros H. apply H. reflexivity.
  - (* l = m :: l' *)
    simpl. destruct (n =? m) eqn:H.
    + (* n =? m = true *)
      intros _. rewrite eqb_eq in H. rewrite H.
      left. reflexivity.
    + (* n =? m = false *)
      intros H'. right. apply IHl'. apply H'.
Qed.

(** In the first branch after [destruct], we explicitly apply
    the [eqb_eq] lemma to the equation generated by
    destructing [n =? m], to convert the assumption [n =? m
    = true] into the assumption [n = m]; then we had to [rewrite]
    using this assumption to complete the case. *)

(** We can streamline this sort of reasoning by defining an inductive
    proposition that yields a better case-analysis principle for [n =?
    m].  Instead of generating the assumption [(n =? m) = true], which
    usually requires some massaging before we can use it, this
    principle gives us right away the assumption we really need: [n =
    m].

    Following the terminology introduced in [Logic], we call this
    the "reflection principle for equality on numbers," and we say
    that the boolean [n =? m] is _reflected in_ the proposition [n =
    m]. *)

Inductive reflect (P : Prop) : bool -> Prop :=
  | ReflectT (H :   P) : reflect P true
  | ReflectF (H : ~ P) : reflect P false.

(** The [reflect] property takes two arguments: a proposition
    [P] and a boolean [b].  It states that the property [P]
    _reflects_ (intuitively, is equivalent to) the boolean [b]: that
    is, [P] holds if and only if [b = true].

    To see this, notice that, by definition, the only way we can
    produce evidence for [reflect P true] is by showing [P] and then
    using the [ReflectT] constructor.  If we invert this statement,
    this means that we can extract evidence for [P] from a proof of
    [reflect P true].

    Similarly, the only way to show [reflect P false] is by tagging
    evidence for [~ P] with the [ReflectF] constructor. *)

(** To put this observation to work, we first prove that the
    statements [P <-> b = true] and [reflect P b] are indeed
    equivalent.  First, the left-to-right implication: *)

Theorem iff_reflect : forall P b, (P <-> b = true) -> reflect P b.

  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros P b H. destruct b eqn:Eb.
  - apply ReflectT. rewrite H. reflexivity.

(** We can think of [reflect] as a kind of variant of the usual "if
    and only if" connective; the advantage of [reflect] is that, by
    destructing a hypothesis or lemma of the form [reflect P b], we
    can perform case analysis on [b] while _at the same time_
    generating appropriate hypothesis in the two branches ([P] in the
    first subgoal and [~ P] in the second). *)

(** Let's use [reflect] to produce a smoother proof of

    [destruct]. *)

(** (To see this clearly, execute the two proofs of
    [filter_not_empty_In] with Coq and observe the differences in

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced, optional (filter_challenge)

    Let's prove that our definition of [filter] from the [Poly]
    chapter matches an abstract specification.  Here is the
    specification, written out informally in English:

    A list [l] is an "in-order merge" of [l1] and [l2] if it contains
    all the same elements as [l1] and [l2], in the same order as [l1]
    and [l2], but possibly interleaved.  For example,

    [1;4;6;2;3]

    is an in-order merge of

    [1;6;2]

    and

    [4;3].

    Now, suppose we have a set [X], a function [test: X->bool], and a
    list [l] of type [list X].  Suppose further that [l] is an
    in-order merge of two lists, [l1] and [l2], such that every item
    in [l1] satisfies [test] and no item in [l2] satisfies test.  Then
    [filter test l = l1].

    Translate this specification into a Coq theorem and prove
    it.  (You'll need to begin by defining what it means for one list
    to be a merge of two others.  Do this with an inductive relation,
    not a [Fixpoint].)  *)

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, advanced, optional (filter_challenge_2)

    A different way to characterize the behavior of [filter] goes like
    this: Among all subsequences of [l] with the property that [test]
    evaluates to [true] on all their members, [filter test l] is the
    longest.  Formalize this claim and prove it. *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (palindromes)

    A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backwards as
    forwards.

    - Define an inductive proposition [pal] on [list X] that
      captures what it means to be a palindrome. (Hint: You'll need
      three cases.  Your definition should be based on the structure
      of the list; just having a single constructor like

        c : forall l, l = rev l -> pal l

      may seem obvious, but will not work very well.)

    - Prove that
    - Prove ([pal_app_rev]) that

       forall l, pal (l ++ rev l).

    - Prove ([pal_rev] that)

       forall l, pal l -> l = rev l.

       forall x n, pal (repeat x n) /\ pal (repeat x (S n)).

    - You might need a lemma for that last proof. You might 
      want to try proving the left hand side of the repeat 
      statement alone: Is it easier?

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, standard, optional (palindrome_converse)

    Again, the converse direction is significantly more difficult, due
    to the lack of evidence.  Using your definition of [pal] from the
    previous exercise, prove that

     forall l, l = rev l -> pal l.

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced, optional (NoDup)

    Recall the definition of the [In] property from the [Logic]
    chapter, which asserts that a value [x] appears at least once in a
    list [l]: *)

(* Fixpoint In (A : Type) (x : A) (l : list A) : Prop :=
   match l with
   | [] => False
   | x' :: l' => x' = x \/ In A x l'
   end *)

(** Your first task is to use [In] to define a proposition [disjoint X
    l1 l2], which should be provable exactly when [l1] and [l2] are
    lists (with elements of type X) that have no elements in
    common. *)

(* FILL IN HERE *)

(** Next, use [In] to define an inductive proposition [NoDup X
    l], which should be provable exactly when [l] is a list (with
    elements of type [X]) where every member is different from every
    other.  For example, [NoDup nat [1;2;3;4]] and [NoDup
    bool []] should be provable, while [NoDup nat [1;2;1]] and
    [NoDup bool [true;true]] should not be.  *)

(** Finally, state and prove one or more interesting theorems relating
    [disjoint], [NoDup] and [++] (list append).  *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced, optional (pigeonhole_principle)

    The _pigeonhole principle_ states a basic fact about counting: if
    we distribute more than [n] items into [n] pigeonholes, some
    pigeonhole must contain at least two items.  As often happens, this
    apparently trivial fact about numbers requires non-trivial
    machinery to prove, but we now have enough... *)

(** First prove an easy and useful lemma. *)

Lemma in_split : forall (X:Type) (x:X) (l:list X),
  In x l ->
  exists l1 l2, l = l1 ++ x :: l2.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** Now define a property [repeats] such that [repeats X l] asserts
    that [l] contains at least one repeated element (of type [X]).  *)

Inductive repeats {X:Type} : list X -> Prop :=
  (* FILL IN HERE *)
.

(* Do not modify the following line: *)
Definition manual_grade_for_check_repeats : option (nat*string) := None.

(** Now, here's a way to formalize the pigeonhole principle.  Suppose
    list [l2] represents a list of pigeonhole labels, and list [l1]
    represents the labels assigned to a list of items.  If there are
    more items than labels, at least two items must have the same
    label -- i.e., list [l1] must contain repeats.

    This proof is much easier if you use the [excluded_middle]
    hypothesis to show that [In] is decidable, i.e., [forall x l, (In x
    l) \/ ~ (In x l)].  However, it is also possible to make the proof
    go through _without_ assuming that [In] is decidable; if you
    manage to do this, you will not need the [excluded_middle]
    hypothesis. *)
Theorem pigeonhole_principle: excluded_middle ->
